## Dataset Details
I worked with two datasets, [1](https://github.com/Debraj-Bora/Excel-Portfolio/blob/main/Data%20Cleaning/data_1_raw.xlsx) & [2](https://github.com/Debraj-Bora/Excel-Portfolio/blob/main/Data%20Cleaning/data_2_raw.xlsx),
which contains random unclean data.

## Project Overview
I cleaned and processed two unclean data sets in Excel to ensure data quality and consistency. The cleaning steps included removing duplicates, handling missing values, and standardizing formats. 
I also removed white spaces. These preprocessing steps ensured that the data was ready for further analysis, enabling accurate insights and better decision-making.
- Skills Used: Data Cleaning, Removing Duplicates, Removing White Spaces, Satnadardizing Formats.
