  - **Commute Distance & Purchases:** Shorter commute distances (0-1 miles and 2-5 miles) showed a higher likelihood of purchasing bikes, while those with longer commutes (5+ miles) had lower purchase rates, with the lowest in the 10+ miles category (~29%).  
  - **Income & Purchasing Trends:** Higher income individuals were less likely to purchase bikes, while middle-income groups showed the highest purchase rates.  
  - **Marital Status & Purchases:** Married individuals were more likely to buy bikes compared to single individuals.  
  - **Occupation Impact:** Sales and skilled labor professions had the highest bike purchase rates.
