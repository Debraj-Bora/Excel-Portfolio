## Dataset Details
This [dataset]() contains coffee sales records across different countries, detailing purchase trends for various coffee types (Arabica, Excelsa, Liberica, and Robusta). 
The objective was to analyze monthly sales fluctuations, identify seasonal demand trends, and determine key customer segments to optimize sales strategies.

  #### **Sales Influence by Coffee Type:**
  - Arabica had the highest demand in February, suggesting a seasonal preference.
  - Excelsa showed peak sales in June, indicating it may be more popular in warmer months.
  - Liberica saw its highest sales in January, potentially linked to holiday consumption trends.
  - Robusta had the best performance in September, which could be driven by supply chain or regional preferences.
  #### **Monthly Sales Fluctuations & Trends:**
  - Sales fluctuated significantly across months, with the highest sales recorded in June ($4,843.20) and the lowest in August ($2,326.96).
  - The most stable sales periods were observed in March, June, and December, making them ideal for marketing and promotional campaigns.

  #### **Country-Wise Sales Patterns:**
  - The United States contributed the largest share of sales ($35,639), indicating a strong coffee market.
  - Ireland ($6,697) and the UK ($2,799) had lower sales, which may suggest a smaller but consistent market for premium coffee.
  #### **Customer Buying Behavior:**
  - High-spending customers were identified, with the top spender, Allis Wilmore, purchasing $317 worth of coffee.
  - The top 5 customers collectively contributed a significant portion of total revenue, making them potential targets for loyalty programs or exclusive offers.
